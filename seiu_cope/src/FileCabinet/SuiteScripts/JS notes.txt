Statements:
- in computer, the group of words, numbers and operator that perform a task is call Statement.
 ex: a = b * 2;

- Varaibles: Variables are the container that hold the value in program.
- litteral value:  Vlue wihtout any container is called " litteral value".
- perform: is a collection of Statements.
- expressions: expressions is called to Varaibles, value and group of all words, numbers and operators
    ex: a and b are Variable expression.
            2 is a litteral expression.
            b*2 is an arithemetic expression.
            = is an assignment expression.
            function is also an expression.

Interpreter and compliler: these helps to translate the code that can be understand by computer.
Interpreter: it interpret each line from top to bottom
compliler: it complies the whole code in one go.

Javascript Interpreter: Javascript complies the code and run on the fly.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
Developer tool console: knowldeg about "Developer tool console". it has console API.
    short command: ctrl+ shift+I (windows) | ctrl + command + I (MAC).

    we can use some formate specifier in console:
        %s	String
        %d or %i	Integer
        %f	Floating point value
        %o	Expandable DOM element (as displayed in the ‘Elements’ tab of the dev tools)
        %O	Expandable JavaScript object
        %c	Formats the output using the CSS style you provide
    
        ex 1:
        var number = 11 * 9;
        var color = 'red';
        console.log('%d %s balloons', number, color);
        
        ex 2:
        console.log('%cThis text is styled!', 'color: #86CC00; background-color: blue; font-size: 20px; padding: 3px;')
        
some methods of Developer tool:
    - console.assert(first parameter for boolean, second param is to show data).
        var count = 5;
        console.assert(count > 10, 'count is not larger than 10');

    console.count("description") :  it tell count of method that how many times it calls. 
        ex: when user wants to know the function call.
        function clickHandler() {
            console.count('Click handler called');
        }
        for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            clickHandler();
        }

    - console.dir(object): This method is especially useful for examining HTML elements, as it will display the DOM representation of the element rather than the XML representation displayed.
    ex: console.log(document.body);
        console.dir(document.body);
